tips to organizing research

Name: Hayden Smedley

I would like to tell people at parties that I am a Data Scientist

At work during the past three months I have been directing traffic at UMD Basketball games, patroling campus and guarding campus buildings.

As I work for campus police as a Police Aide, I do not have much work to organize. However, I do find a calender helpful for reminders. A strong knowledge of the campus and good people skills are also very helpful.
